## Gambling

One of the most popular things to do during the World Cup is betting on who will win.

Several websites post a Odds number like -500 but what does that actually mean in percent probability.

To convert the odd number to winnings, you would use the following formula:

if American number odds is negative:

```{math}
:label: odds_less_0

winnings = \frac{AmntBet}{100}|odds|

```

if American odds number is positive:
```{math}
:label: odds_more_0

winnings = \frac{AmntBet}{odds}100

```
For example, if the odds are -200 and you bet 100 dollars, your winnings are $frac{100}{100}*|-200|$ for a total of 200 dollars according to equation {eq}`odds_less_0`. If the odds were above 0, you would need to use equation {eq}`odds_more_0`.

```{note}
Betting against the odds (>0) yields greater winnings if the country you bet on wins.
```

To convert the odds to a %probability of winning, you would use the following formula:


```{math}
:label: odds_probs

probability of winning = \frac{AmtWin-AmtBet}{AmtWin}

```

Therefore, if you bet 100 dollars on a -500 odds team, the odds would be $ frac{500-100}{500} = 80% $according to equation {eq}`odds_probs`.

```{danger}
Betting is at your own risk, if the team you betted on loses, you will lose the amount you wagered. 
```
