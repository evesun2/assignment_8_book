### Circumference

One of the things that has changed about him is his circumference which you can calculate using the following formula:


```{math}
:label: circumference

C = 2 \Pi r

```

```{danger}
Calculating the circumference of a human is not very accurate as humans are not perfect circles.
```

### Radius

According to a recent report in [The42](https://www.the42.ie/brazils-ronaldo-loses-17-kilos-in-reality-show-719895-Dec2012/){cite}`afp_brazils_nodate`, Ronaldo had a waist circumference of 42 inches which is 107 cm. Using equation {eq}`circumference`, we can calcuate his radius as follows:

```{math}
:label: radius

r = \frac{C}{2\Pi} = \frac{107}{2\Pi} = 17 cm

```

According to {eq}`radius`, current Ronaldo has a radius of 17 cm. 

```{tip}
To calculate Ronaldo's area you can use $A = \Pi r^2$.
